# Introduction

This pertains to third part which essentially performs monitoring, reporting and interface for intervention.
For existing open positions and already closed positions, the corresponding structure in Redis is referred and reports extracted. To generate graphs, the log file generated by trade execution programs as well as historical price data is referred. Typically reports being generated are snapshot at two minutes interval.
 
## Description

<TBD>

## Further To do

Backlogs :
	* Create mobile devices friendly reports
	* Make reports accessible from anywhere, anytime but with authentication
	* Create more real-time reports (than 2 minute snapshot)
	* Enable two factor authentication for modifying parameters of execution
	* Enable more parameters to be tweaked through the interface - which could fine tune / change trade execution behaviour
	* Enable better docuemntation / explanation of various tweakable parameters and possible impact of modifying it
	* Enable "What-if" analysis with few parameters of behaviour of a trade post exit, which could be used for fine tuning parameters in future.
